A/C#    C#m B A B

[Verse 1]
C#m                   B
Look into My eyes and say you don't believe
A             B              C#m
All of this I did to be with you
C#m                 B
Darkness in the sky as My Father cried
     A               B             C#m
And then He turned away and then I died

[Verse 2]
C#m                   B
Look into My eyes and say you don't believe
A             B              C#m
All of this I did to be with you
C#m                 B
Darkness in the sky as My Father tried
A             B               A
And then He turned away and then I died

[Chorus]
A                           B
Follow Me, choose to follow Me
A                 B                  C#m
Take a chance and place your hand in Mine
A                    B
Call on Me, let your life see the spring
          A               B             C#m     C#m/D#
Let the adventure of your life begin tonight
        A            B             E       /F#m
Let the rest of your life begin tonight

[Verse 3]
 C#m                      B
More than just to die - I came to show the way
A               B                 C#m
Knowing of the cost to reach you
C#m                 B
Darkness in the sky as My Father tried
    A         B              A
Giving all He had and then I died"
